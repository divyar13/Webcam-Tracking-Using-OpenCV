Webcam tracking of finger using colour detection (red)

Algorithm
1. Set up a connection to the webcam of the laptop
2. Convert each frame of the webcam feed from BGR format to HSV
3. Threshold the image - The image is converted to a binary image wherein the red object is white and the rest of the image is black.
4. Calculate the moment of the white polygon in the thresholded image (using openCV function) in order to obtain the approximate coordinates.
5. Use the openCV line function to draw a line from the previous position to the current position.
6. These coordinates can also be given to a mouse cursor (after scaling to the screen resolution)
